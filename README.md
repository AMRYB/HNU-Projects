# HNU-Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic projects developed by me and my university teammates during our time at HNU.

Some projects are complete and functional. Others are experimental or were built quickly to meet course requirements. We’re sharing them publicly to help others learn — whether as technical references, starting points, or inspiration.

> ⚠️ Note: These projects are for **educational use only**. Please do not claim them as your own in academic submissions.
