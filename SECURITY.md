## First Things First

Don’t worry — no AI wrote this code, no random scripts from sketchy forums either.  
All code here was written by **us and our friends**, manually, with full attention (especially the night before the deadline).  
So no, nothing here will virus your machine.

## Found a Security Issue?

If you happen to find a bug or a potential vulnerability:

1. **Please don’t open a public issue** — we don’t need public drama
2. Instead, email us at: **amr10tuf@gmail.com**
3. Include:
   - Which project?
   - What’s the issue?
   - How can we reproduce it (if possible)?

We’ll get back to you faster than a final exam panic attack.

## Disclaimer

These are **university projects**. Some are complete, some are half-baked, some were just enough to get a passing grade.  
If you're using any of this code in your own serious project — **that’s 100% on you**.

Thanks for keeping things secure. 
We're students, but we code like pros
