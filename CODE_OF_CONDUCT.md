# Code of Conduct – HNU Projects

We don’t expect any problems, honestly. We’re all decent and respectful people here.

But still — these are the guidelines, just to keep things clear and fair.

## Expected Behavior

- Treat others with respect, even if you disagree.
- Use polite, constructive language in comments and discussions.
- Respect the effort put into the projects, whether by us or by contributors.
- Ask questions, suggest ideas, but don’t be rude.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Insults, harassment, or personal attacks of any kind.
- Racist, sexist, or discriminatory language or behavior.
- Using someone else’s work and claiming it as your own.
- Trying to create drama, spam, or troll intentionally.

## Reporting Issues

Again, we don’t think you’ll need this, but if anything happens:

Please report serious violations to: **amr10tuf@gmail.com**

All reports will be handled privately and professionally.
